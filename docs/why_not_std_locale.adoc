= Why does Strf not use `std::locale` ?
:source-highlighter: prettify

The C++ Standard Library provides the `std::locale` class
( used to manage _facet_ object ), as well as the `std::numpunct` class
template. So, why did Strf define its own
facets design ( and its own `strf::numpunct` ) instead of just using
what is already well-know and available by the standard ?

To start with, `std::locale` has the some disadvantages:
// flaws:

* It forces the use dynamic memory allocation.
* It requires RTTI and exceptions enabled
* It's not available in https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/freestanding[freestanding]
  implementations.

These things may be irrelevant in many scenarios,
but they are problematic in others.
They were probably unavoidable back
in the time `std::locale` was created,
but we can do better now with modern C++.

// taking more advantange of static polymorfism.

// In C++11, however, we can explore new kinds of designs.
// It seemed natural to try something different,
// something more based on static polymorfism,
// which is more trendy these days.
//
// However, one of goals in Strf
// was to find a design that would take
// best advantage of what C++11 has to offer.
// So it would be only natural to try alternatives.

The design of `strf::facets_pack` class template is similar
to as of `std::tuple`, holding its elements by value,
in contrast to `std::locale` were they
are managed through reference counting.

`strf::get_facet` is as fast as a typical getter: it
just returns the reference of the requested object, or,
if it is not present, a default value,
while `std::get_facet` probably needs
to perform some run-time processing.

There is no base class that facets in Strf need to derive from.
They only need to satisfy the __<<strf_hpp#Facet,Facet>>__
type requirements, which is not really demanding.
This provides a great flexibility on how a facet can be designed.
It can be as simple as an enumeration
or as sofisticated as the the charset facets, or the
width calculation facets. But one thing all facet of this
library have in common is that they all are small and
fast to copy, and none of them cause dynamic memory allocation.
// In contrast to the OO approach of `std::locale`, Strf uses
// static polymorfism and is facets are value types.

// It was necessary to create `strf::numpunct` because `std::numpunct`
// could not be used in `strf::facets_pack`. But this, in turn, also
// ended up bringing advantages:

`strf::numpunct` also has some advantages in relation to `std::numpunct`:

* The decimal point and the thousands separator are
  `char32_t` values.
* Punctuation can also be applied on integers printed
  in hexadecimal, octal or binary bases.
* A single `strf::numpunct` object works
  for all character types.
* The grouping is defined in a simple integer,
  which is way more lightweight than using a `std::string`.
* Less boiler plate to manually define the punctuation:
  no need to create a new class that overrides member
  functions. You do it in a single expression:
+
[source,cpp]
----
auto punct = strf::numpunct<10> (3, 2, 1)
    .decimal_point(',')
    .thousands_separator('.');
----

( Be aware that `strf::numpunct` does not affect `bool` values,
contrary to `std::numpunct` which
has the `truename()` and `falsename()` functions.
If you what to change how `bool` values are printed,
see <<howto_override_printable_types#,how to override printable types>>.

// But perhaps the main reason is that the goals
// re different:

Furthermore, `std::locale` and `strf::facets_pack` have been created with
different goals in mind. `std::locale` is about localization,
and it was designed to be used in `std::iostream`.
Strf facets were created to make Strf highly customizable,
kind of a complement to format functions.
Dealing with numeric punctuation just happens to be one thing
they have in common.

// Creating a `std::locale` object causes
// a whole bunch of information from the system to be loaded,
// most of which are not used by Strf.
//
// only a part of which &#x2014; numeric punctuation &#x2014;
// may be used by strf.

// `std::locale` it is only available in
// https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/freestanding[hosted]
// implementation.
//
// Strf aims to be usable in
// https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/freestanding[freestanding]
// environments.
//
// That's why if you want to load punctuation from the
// system's locales, you call the `strf::locale_numpunct()`
// function, which is defined in separate non-freestanding
// header `<strf/locale.hpp>`. But `strf::numpunct` itself
// can be used in a freestanding environment.
// `std::locale` can not.
//
// However, all these arguments are secundary.
// The main point is actually that `std::locale`
// and `strf::facets_pack` have been designed with
// different goals in mind.
// `std::locale` is about localization.
// The facets of Strf not necessary.
// Numeric punctuation is just an intersection.

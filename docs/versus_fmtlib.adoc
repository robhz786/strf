= Comparison between Strf and {fmt}
:source-highlighter: prettify
:sectnums:
:sectnumlevels: 2
:icons: font
:toc: left

A non-exhaustive comparison between Strf {strf-version} and {fmt} 8.0.1.

// == Usability
//
// === Format string versus format functions
//
// {fmt} uses format string, while Strf uses format functions:
//
// [source,cpp]
// ----
// // in {fmt}
// auto s1 = fmt::format("{} in hexadecimal is {:x}", value);
// auto s1 = fmt::format(FMT_STRING("{} in hexadecimal is {:x}"), value);
//
// // in Strf
// auto s3 = strf::to_string(value, "in hexadecimal is", strf::hex(value));
// auto s4 = strf::to_string.tr("{} in hexadecimal is {}", value, strf::hex(value));
//
// using namespace strf::format_functions;
// auto s5 = strf::to_string(value, "in hexadecimal is", hex(value));
// ----
//
// Format strings are more compact, but they are also more error-prone.
// With the `FMT_STRING` macros, the mistakes are caught at compile time,
// but the error messages are not as clear as when using Strf's format functions.
//
// On the other hand, Strf is not able to catch at compile-time an invalid
// positional argument in the {tr-string}.
//
// ////
// As a consequence, Strf tends to be more verbose. Operator overloading
// is commonly employed to aliviate the verbosity, like in the expression `*hex(value) > 20`,
// but it's still not compact as a format string.
//
// In both cases, memorizing all the format options is a burden.
// But when using a format string you additionally need to remember the correct
// order in which the format flags must be written.
// ////
//
// ////

== Capabilities in general

=== {fmt}
Some things that are directly supported by {fmt}, but not by Strf:

- Printing date and time ( link:https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#chrono-api[link] )
- Printing any type that can be printed by `std::ostream` ( link:https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#std-ostream-support[link] )
- Printing `std::tuple` ( https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#ranges-api[link] )
- Specifying colors ( https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#color-api[link] )
- Writing to output iterators ( https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#output-iterator-support[link] )
- Named arguments in the format string. ( https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#named-arguments[link] )
- Alternative functions that follow the `std::printf` format string syntax. ( link:https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#printf-formatting[link] )


=== Strf
Some things that are directly supported by Strf, but not by {fmt}:

* Character encoding conversion

[source,cpp]
----
auto str = strf::to_string( "aaa-"
                          , strf::conv(u"bbb-")
                          , strf::conv(U"ccc-")
                          , strf::conv(L"ddd") );

assert(str   ==  "aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd");
----
[source,cpp]
----
auto str_utf8 = strf::to_u8string
        ( strf::conv("--\xA4--", strf::iso_8859_1<char>)
        , strf::conv("--\xA4--", strf::iso_8859_15<char>));
assert(str_utf8 == u8"--\u00A4----\u20AC--");
----

* Printing `char32_t`

[source,cpp]
----
char32_t ch = 0x20AC;
assert(strf::to_string.with(strf::utf<char>)         (ch) == "\xE2\x82\xAC");
assert(strf::to_string.with(strf::iso_8859_15<char>) (ch) == "\xA4");
assert(strf::to_string.with(strf::iso_8859_1<char>)  (ch) == "?");
----

* Aligning a group of arguments as if they were one

[source,cpp]
----
auto str = strf::to_string
    ("---", strf::join_center(15) ("abc", "def", 123), "---");
assert(str == "---   abcdef123   ---");
----

* When printing range, it is possible to apply formatting:

[source,cpp]
----
int array[] = { 250, 251, 252 };
auto str = strf::to_string
    ( "["
    , *strf::fmt_separated_range(array, " / ").fill('.').hex() > 6
    , "]");
assert(str == "[..0xfa / ..0xfb / ..0xfc]");
----

* When printing range, it is possible to transform the elements:

[source,cpp]
----
std::map<int, const char*> table = { {1, "one"}, {2, "two"}, {1000, "a thousand"} };
auto op = [](auto p) {
    // transforming a std::pair into somthing printable
    return strf::join(p.first, " -> '", p.second, '\'');
};
auto str = strf::to_string('[', strf::separated_range(table, "; ", op), ']');
assert(str == "[1 -> 'one'; 2 -> 'two'; 1000 -> 'a thousand']");
----

// == Format options
// - In Strf the right alignment is the default, in {fmt} it depends on the type
// - In Strf the string precision is the width, in {fmt} is the size
// - float precision
// - In Strf, the `operator~` format function inserts a fill character before non-negative numbers, in {fmt} the `' '` format flag inserts instead a space
// -

== Floating-points

Both libraries are capable of "dynamic precision", __i.e.__ printing a floating-point value with the
minimum amount of digits that ensures that it can be exactly
recovered by a parser.
The difference is that {fmt} only does this when none of formatting flags
`'e'`, `'E'`, `'f'`, `'F'`, `'g'` or `'G'` is used.
Strf does it whenever precision is not specified.

There is also a small difference on how they do the "sing-aware zero-padding",
__i.e.__ inserting zeros after the sign and before the digits, but only
when the value is not NaN nor Infinit.
This behaviour is activated with the zero flag (`'0'`) in {fmt},
and with the `<<strf_hpp#float_pad0,pad0>>` function in Strf. The difference is that in Strf
this zero-padding is decoupled from alignment formatting, so that
you can specify both independently:

[source,cpp]
----
auto result = strf::to_string(strf::pad0(-1.5, 8).fill('_') > 12);
assert(result == "____-00001.5");
----

The last difference has to do with the `long double` type,
which in some systems has more than 64 bits ( on linux,
it has 80 bits on x86 and x86-64 arquitecture ).
Currently, Strf only supports 32 and 64 bits floating-points,
so trying to  print a `long double` value causes a compilation error.

I'm not sure how {fmt} handles larger floating-point types,
but I noticed that the "dynamic precision" doesn't work:
[source,cpp]
----
fmt::print(stdout, "{}\n", sqrt(2.0));  // prints 1.4142135623730951 (ok)
fmt::print(stdout, "{}\n", sqrtl(2.0)); // prints 1.41421
----

== Numeric punctuation

{fmt}'s and strf's ways of applying punctuation to integer and
floating-point arguments are analogous.

In {fmt}, you pass a `std::locale` object as an argument,
before the format string, then use the `'L'` format flag
for those arguments that shall conform to the `std::numpunct`
facet installed in that `std::locale` object.

In strf, you pass a `strf::numpunct` object to
the `with` function, and apply the `punct` or `operator!`
format function in those arguments you want to be
punctuated.

So the basic difference is that while {fmt} uses `std::locale`
and `std::numpunct`, Strf has its own facets arquitecture.
The rationale and advantages for this are explained in
<<why_not_std_locale#,another article>>.

== Multilingual support

Strf has some extra advantages over {fmt} when developing an application
that needs to provides multilingual support:

Less translations errors::
Since the programmer is commonly not same person who translates
the messages and messages can be ambiguous, translation mistakes can happen.
So, Strf allows you to add comments in the {tr-string} to prevent
misinterpretations.

Less syntax errors::
The syntax of {tr-string} is less error-prone than the {fmt}'s format string.
It is true that {fmt} can detect syntax error at compile-time with
`FMT_STRING` or `FMT_COMPILE`, but it is very difficult ( if not impossible )
to use such macros in multilingual programs, since the format
strings are then likely to be evaluated at run-time.

Reusability::
In Strf, translation is decoupled from formatting.
You can use the same tr-string multiple times with
different format options.
You can also joins or other "special" input types to
reuse a tr-string:
+
[source,cpp]
----
// returns "Failed to connect to server {}" translated to some language
const char* tr_failed_to_connect_to_server_X();

// ...
strf::to(dest).tr(tr_failed_to_connect_to_server_X(), "some_server_name.com");

// Now passing an ip address.
// No need to create a new tr-string "Failed to connect to server {}.{}.{}.{}"
std::uint8_t ip[4];
// ...
strf::to(dest).tr( tr_failed_to_connect_to_server_X()
                 , strf::join(ip[0], '.', ip[1], '.', ip[2], '.', ip[3]) );
         // or   , strf::separated_range(ip, ".");
----

== Width calculation

:std_width: pass:n[http://eel.is/c++draft/format.string.std#11]

When alignment formatting is applied over a input string,
the formatting library needs to estimate how wide that string is
to determine how many fill characters it shall be print.

In old formatting libraries like printf such witdh is simply
assumed to be equal to the string's size. This is certainly not
accurate if the string is enconded in UTF-8 or UTF-16, were multiple
code units can represent a single codepoint and
multiple codepoints can represent a single grapheme cluster.
In addition, some codepoints are expected to have
the double of the regular width, while
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character#Unicode[some others]
are actually expected to be narrower.

The C{plus}{plus} Standard mandates `std::format` to take the width of
each grapheme cluster as the width of its leading codepoint, which is
`1` or `2` according to whether is within certain ranges.footnote:[{std_width}].
In Strf, this behaviour is implemented in the `strf::std_width_calc`,
which is the default <<quick_reference#width_calculator,width calculation facet>>.

// The width calculation in the lastest version of {fmt} (8.0.1) doesn't
// take into account grapheme clustering yet, but it takes into account
// the codepoints width double width.

However there is obviouly a performance price for more accuracy.
And that's the advatange of Strf: width calculation is customizable.
You can choose a less accurate but faster algorithm if you want.
Or, you can try to implement one which is even more accurate,
or tailored to the environment the string is printed, __i.e.__
that takes into account the language, the font, etc.

// Or, if know have extra information about how the text will be rendered
// ( like the font or the laguage ), you can implement your one
// width calculation facet with a lailored algorithm.



== Error handling policy

Neither {fmt} nor Strf ever change the value of `errno`.

{fmt} throws an exception when it founds someting wrong at run-time.
// A run-time error can be something wrong in the format string
// ( which can be avoided at compile-time if you use `FMT_STRING` or `FMT_COMPILE` )
// or some system error.

Strf does not throw, but it also doesn't prevent exceptions
to propagate from whatever it depends on, like the language runtime or
user extensions. So an exception may arise when writing to a `std::streambuf`
or `std::string`, for example.

Instead of throwing, Strf's policy is to print the replacement character `U'\uFFFD'`
( or `'?'`, depending on the charset ) indicating where the error occured.
This can happen when parsing the {tr-string} or in
<<quick_reference#charset_conversion,charset conversion>> or sanitization.
However, in case you want it to do something more than just that ( like an
to throw, or to log a message ), this can be specified with the
`<<strf_hpp#tr_error_notifier_c,tr_error_notifier_c>>` and/or
`<<strf_hpp#transcoding_error_notifier_c,transcoding_error_notifier_c>>
facets.

In addition to that, depending on the <<quick_reference#destinations,destination>>,
the return type of the <<tutorial#syntax,basic usage syntax>> may contain an error
indication. For example, when writing to a `char*`, the returned object contains
a `bool` member `truncated` that tells whether the destination memory
is too small.

//  == Performance
//
//  If you look at the
//  http://robhz786.github.io/strf-benchmarks/v{strf-version}/results.html[benchmarks],
//  you can see that the performances of Strf and {fmt} depend on several things,
//  like what you are printing, how you do it, what are the formatting options,
//  the compiler, the destination type, etc. There are situations where {fmt} is faster,
//  and others when others where it is Strf. However it is possible to take some general conclusions.
//
//  When it comes to writting to `char*`, we can conclude that:
//
//  * `strf::to` is faster than `fmt::format_to_n`
//  * `strf::to` is faster than `fmt::format_to`, except in the following two situations:
//  ** `fmt::format_to` is invoked with `FMT_COMPILE` and no formatting option is applied
//  ** `fmt::format_to` is invoked with `FMT_COMPILE` and `strf::to` is invoked with the tr-string
//
//  When comparing `strf::to_string` against `fmt::format`,
//  we conclude `strf::to_string` is faster than `fmt::format`,
//  except when `strf::to_string` is invoked with the tr-string
//  at the same time that no formatting option is applied.
//
//
//  Of course, it's very possible to be
//  exceptions for the above conclusions, since these
//  http://robhz786.github.io/strf-benchmarks/v{strf-version}/results.html[benchmarks]
//  are far of covering all possible situations.

== Extensibility

=== Adding printable types

It may be a little bit more difficult to learn how to add a printable type in Strf
than how it is in {fmt}. There are more things to learn, more concepts to grasp.
However, once have this knowledge, you will find it easier to deal with the
real cases scenarious.

For instance, the {fmt} documentation provides
link:https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#formatting-user-defined-types[an example]
of how to do it with a struct named `point` that contains two `double` variables.
If you compare it with the snippet below,
which does the similar thing in Strf, you may find that the Strf's way
is more complicated, since the code is larger and it requires more
specific knowledge about the library.
But you must take into account that this sample supports all
formatting options that would be expected in a real case scenario:
all the <<strf_hpp#float_formatter,floating-point formatting options>>,
as well the <<strf_hpp#alignment_formatter,alignment formatting options>>,
while the {fmt} sample handles only the `'f'` or `'g'` format flags.
Also, the code below is generic, in the sense that it works with all characters
types as well as all character encodings:

[source,cpp]
----
template <typename FloatT>
struct point{ FloatT x, y; };

template <typename FloatT>
struct strf::printable_traits<point<FloatT>> {
    using forwarded_type = point<FloatT>;
    using formatters = strf::tag<strf::alignment_formatter, strf::float_formatter>; // <1>

    template <typename CharT, typename Pre, typename FPack, typename... T>
    constexpr static auto make_input
        ( strf::tag<CharT>
        , Pre& pre
        , const FPack& fp
        , strf::printable_with_fmt<T...> arg ) noexcept
    {
        point<FloatT> p = arg.value();
        auto arg2 = strf::join
            ( (CharT)'('
            , strf::fmt(p.x).set_float_format(arg.get_float_format()) // <2>
            , strf::conv(", ")                                        // <3>
            , strf::fmt(p.y).set_float_format(arg.get_float_format()) // <4>
            , (CharT)')' )
            .set_alignment_format(arg.get_alignment_format());        // <5>
        return strf::make_printer_input<CharT>(pre, fp, arg2);
    }
};
----
<1> This line defines what are the formatting options applicable to `point<FloatT>` :
    alignment as well as floating-point formatting. You can, of course,
    also create your own _formatters_.
<2> Here we forward the floating-point formatting to `p.x`.
<3> Converting the string `", "` to whatever the destination encoding is.
<4> Forwarding floating-point formatting to `p.y`.
<5> Applying the alignment formatting.

However, it must be acknowledged that this example is facilitated by the fact that
it is possible to convert a `point` into another value ( a `join` object )
that the library already knows how to print. If this was not case,
we needed to implement a _printer_ class that do things in a more low-level way.
This is explained in the <<howto_add_printable_types#,documentation>>.
It starts with a simple case, and gradually moves towards more challenging
examples.

=== Adding destinations

// // The discussion about extensibility involves not only
//
// // there is another extensibility aspect consider
//
// Extensibility is not just about what can be printed,
// but also where the content is printed to ( as well as other things ).
//
// For example, it is common for codebases to define a string class of its own,
// instead of using `std::string`. In this case, it would naturally be desirable
//
// to be able to use the formatting library to write into such string type.
//
// the formatting library to be able to write into d
//
// You can extend Strf not only by adding new printable types
// but in other aspects as well.
//
// Strf can be extended not only in regard of what can be printed,
// but also where the content is printed to.
//
// When one talks about extending a formatting library, it usually
// means
//
// Extend what can be printed by a formatting library,
// but also
//
// It is good think when a formatting library allows you to extend
// what it can printed, but it is also desirable to be to change
// where the content can be printed to.
//
// But there is another aspect that is also important: to be able to
// customize where the content is printed to.
//
// We want a formatting library to be extensible, but not only in regard
// of what can it print, but also where can it print to.
//
//
// Both Strf and {fmt} are extensible, but not only in regard
// of what they can print, but also where can the content is printed to.
//
// <<howto_add_destination#,This document>> explains
//
// If you want {fmt} to print to an alternative destination,
// you need to have or define a type that satisfies the
// __OutputIterator__ requirements.
//

// If you want Strf to print to an alternative destination,
// you need to create a class that derives from
// `strf::<<destination_hpp#destination,destination>>`.
// Having an object of such type, you can print things to it with the
// `strf::<<quick_reference#to_destination_ref,to>>(strf::destination<__CharT__>&)`
// function template.
//
// In the case of {fmt}, you need to have (or create) a type that satisfies the
// __OutputIterator__ requirements. With that, you can use the `{fmt_print_to}`
// and `{fmt_print_to_n}` function templates.

Both libraries support the usual destinations: `FILE*`, `std::ostream&`, `std::string`,
and `char*`. In case you need to send the content to somewhere else, {fmt} provides
the generic function `fmt::format_to` that writes to output iterators. This
way, all you have to do is to create an adapter that conforms to the
OutputIterator requirements and that writes to your desired target.

In Strf, what you do instead is to create a concrete class that derives from
the `{destination}` abstract class template. Having an object of such type,
you can print things to it with the
`strf::<<quick_reference#to_destination_ref,to>>(strf::destination<__CharT__>&)`
function template.

However, in Strf you can go a bit further and create your own
__target expression__ to be used in the <<tutorial#syntax,basic usage syntax>>
of the library. For example, suppose a codebase uses a string class of its own
instead of `std::string`. Suppose it's name is `xstring`:
just like there is `<<quick_reference#targets,strf::to_string>>`,
it is possible to define
a __target expression__ named `to_xstring` intended to
create `xstring` objects. If desirable, it is possible to implement it
in such a way that the size of the content is calculated
before the the `xstring` object is constructed, so that the adequate
amount of memory can be preallocated.

This is all explained in <<howto_add_destination#,this guide>>.

== A polymorphic destination

Both Strf and {fmt} can write to `std::basic_ostream`.
However, `std::basic_ostream` has some problems:

* It can not be used in https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/freestanding[freestanding] environments.
* It is difficult for most people to implement specializations.
* Although it has a specialization that writes to `std::string`, it has bad performance.
* It has no specialization to write to `char*`.

That's why Strf has its own abraction for output streams:
`strf::{destination}`. Initially created for internal use,
after many redesigns and renamings it's now part of the public API,
and is an alternative to `strf::basic_ostream` and/or `strf::basic_streambuf`
without the issues mentioned above.

If you need to create a function aimed to
provide some textual content ( or even binary content ),
you can make it write it into a `strf::destination` object taken by reference
as a parameter:

[source,cpp]
----
void get_message(strf::destination<char>& dest) {
    strf::to(dest) (...);
}
----
But why not just return a `std::string` instead? Because, despite being
the usual approach, it's not suitable or possible in some situations.
In embedded, one would probably prefer `get_message` to write to
`char*`, which, conversely, is not what one would want if
using `std::string` is not an issue. Doesn't it bothers you that
there is no good universal solution for such a common task?
So, maybe `strf::destination` can be the one.
It satisfies both worlds by leading to the caller the decision
of which `strf::destination` specialization to use:
it can be `<<to_string_hpp#basic_string_maker,basic_string_maker>>`
if one wants the content be stored in a `std::string`,
or `<<destination_hpp#basic_cstr_destination,basic_cstr_destination>>`
or `<<destination_hpp#array_destination,array_destination>>`
if one wants it into a `char*`. There are
<<quick_reference#destination_types,other specializations>> as well,
and it's easy to <<howto_add_destination#,create a new one>>.

But what's performance overhead ? I mean, writing to
`<<destination_hpp#basic_cstr_destination,basic_cstr_destination>>` or
`<<destination_hpp#array_destination,array_destination>>` can not
be as fast as writing directly to `char*`, or is it? Well, actually, yes,
it should be, at least if you are using Strf, because what
`strf::to(__char_ptr__, __size__)(...)` internally does is to create
a `basic_cstr_destination` object then write into it. Similarly,
`strf::to_string` internally uses `strf::string_maker`.

As far as I know, {fmt} doesn't provide anything equivalent
to `strf::destination`. Yes, it can write to generic output
iterators (with `fmt::format_to` and `fmt::format_to_n`), but
that's not as good &mdash; you can't have a function that writes into
a generic output iterator, unless it's actually a function template,
and some can't be.

However, I must acknowledge that `strf::destination` doesn't
count so much as an advantage of Strf over {fmt}, because you can
use it with {fmt} too!
You just need to create an output iterator adapter, which can be
done with the `<<iterator_hpp#make_iterator,make_iterator>>`
function template, defined in `<<iterator_hpp#,<strf/iterator.hpp>>>`
( a small header that impacts very little the compilation time ):

[source,cpp,subs=normal]
----
#include <strf/iterator.hpp>
#include <fmt/core.h>

void get_message(strf::destination<char>& dest) {
    auto it = make_iterator(dest);
    fmt::format_to(it, ...);
    // ...
}
----

So, even if you are not willing use Strf as a formatting library instead of {fmt}
or std::format, you might still consider `strf::destination`.
In this case, however, there is some overhead ( using {fmt} to write to an
`strf::destination` object tends to be slower than when {fmt} writes directly
to the actual final destination ), as shown in the
http://robhz786.github.io/strf-benchmarks/v{strf-version}/results.html[benchmarks].

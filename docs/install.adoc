= Building, installing and using the Strf library
:source-highlighter: prettify

== Header-only or static library

:runtime_benchmarks_link: pass:n[http://robhz786.github.io/strf-benchmarks/v{strf-version}/results.html]
:compilation_benchmarks_link: pass:n[http://robhz786.github.io/strf-benchmarks/v{strf-version}/results.html#_compilation_performance]

The header-only variant has shown better performance on clang and gcc
footnote:[{runtime_benchmarks_link}]
and does not necessarily make the
generated binaries bigger &#x2014; it depends on how much
Strf is invoked in your code.footnote:[{compilation_benchmarks_link}]

To use Strf as a header-only all you need to do is to add
to the include paths of your project the `include` directory
that is inside root directory of Strf.
To use Strf as a static library you need also to define
the macro `STRF_SEPARATE_COMPILATION`.
To genereate the static library you only need to compile
one source file: `src/strf.cpp`.

Or, you can use CMake.

== If you are using CMake

If you use CMake, you are probably already know with the proccess. Anyway:

=== Option 1: The simple way ( using `add_subdirectory` )

I don't see the CMake documentation recomending this approach, but
I also don't see any problem in it when importing a library that is
small and has no dependencies, which is the case of Strf.
The idea is that you copy the whole Strf folder ( the one that
is created by the command `git clone https://github.com/robhz786/strf` )
somewhere inside your project directory ( like in a `external/`
or `third_party/` subdirectory ), and then, in your CMakeLists.txt file,
you add the command:

[source,subs=normal]
----
add_subdirectory(__<strf-dir>__)
----

This adds two targets in your project: `Strf::StrfHeaderOnly`
and `Strf::StrfStatic`.

=== Option 2: Export and import

// https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-stage/guide/importing-exporting/index.html

First you install Strf in some location:

[source,subs=normal]
----
git clone https://github.com/robhz786/strf
mkdir build_strf
cd build_strf
cmake ../strf
cmake --build .
cmake --install . --prefix __<installation-directory>__
----

The `__<installation-directory>__` used above must added to
the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` variable used in your CMake project.

[source,subs=normal]
----
cmake -G __<generator-name>__ -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=__<installation-directory>__ ... __<path-to-source>__
----

Then, the command `find_package(Strf)` will bring into your
project the targets `Strf::StrfHeaderOnly` and
`Strf::StrfStatic`.

[source,cmake]
----
# In your CMake project file:
# ...

find_package(Strf)
target_link_libraries(your_target Strf::StrfHeaderOnly)
# or
# target_link_libraries(your_target Strf::StrfStatic)
----

== Running the unit tests

To build the unit test, just turn on the `STRF_BUILD_TEST` CMake option:
[source,subs=normal]
----
cmake -G __<generator-name>__  -DSTRF_BUILD_TEST=ON ... __<Strf-root-dir>__
cmake --build . && ctest
----
== Freestanding Strf

There is an experimental variant of the Strf library: if you use the CMake option
`STRF_FREESTANDING` ( through the cmake command option `-DSTRF_FREESTANDING=ON` ), then
Strf will only depend on https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/freestanding[freestanding]
parts of the C++ Standard Library. Not even the functions declared in `<cstring>`
header ( like `memcpy` and `strcpy` ) are used, unless you use the CMake option
`STRF_WITH_CSTRING` ( by passing the command option `-DSTRF_WITH_CSTING=ON` ).
This options causes Strf to use `<cstring>` functions even when `STRF_FREESTANDING`
is on, which is highly recommended when such functions are available ( because
Strf will otherwise use slow loop-based alternatives )

If you are not using CMake, you instead define the macros:

[source,cpp]
----
// Make sure these defines come before including any of the library's header
#define STRF_FREESTANDING
#define STRF_WITH_CSTRING
#include <strf.hpp>
----

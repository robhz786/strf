== Syntax [[syntax]]

image::syntax.svg[]

The __dest-expr__ is an expression that defines where the
content goes to as well as the return type of the whole expression above.
The library provides many options to be used as the __dest-expr__,
and you can even define your own.
However, for convenience, most code samples in this tutorial use `to_string`:
[source,cpp]
----
#include <strf/to_string.hpp>

void sample() {
    int x = 200;
    std::string str = strf::to_string(x, " in hexadecimal is ", strf::hex(x));
    assert(str == "200 in hexadecimal is c8");
}
----

////
You can see that there is not format string, as in `printf`.
Instead, __format functions_ ( as the `hex` above ) specify formatting.
So in order to use translation tool like
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext[gettext] you need to use an alternative
syntax, which employs what is called here as the "Tr-string":
////

You can see that there is no format string here, as there is in `printf`.
Instead, __format functions__ ( like `hex` above ) specify formatting.
The expression `strf::hex(x)` is equivalent to `strf::fmt(x).hex()`.
The return of `strf::fmt(x)` is an object containing the value of `x` in addition to
format information which can be edited with member ( format ) functions
following the
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Named_Parameter[named parameter idiom]
, like this: `strf::fmt(255).hex().p(4).fill(U'.') > 10`

To use a translation tools like
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext[gettext],
you need to use the `tr` function,
which employs what is called here as the __tr-string__:

////
Strf does not have a format string, as `printf` has. But that doesn't mean you
can't use i18n tools like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext[gettext].
You just need to use an alternative syntax, which employs what is called here as
the <<quick_reference#tr_string,tr-string>>:
////

[source,cpp,subs=normal]
----
auto s = strf::to_string.tr("{} in hexadecimal is {}", x, strf::hex(x));
----

The `reserve`, `no_reserve` and `reserve_calc` functions are only available for some
__dest-expr__s, `to_string` being one of them.
Using `reserve(size)` causes the destination to reserve enough space
to store `size` characters. `reserve_calc()` has the same effect,
except that it calculates the number of characters for you.

[[facets]]
=== Facets

The `with` function receives __facet objects__,
which somehow complement format functions. They also influence
how the data is printed. A facet example is the `lettercase` enumeration:

[source,cpp]
----
namespace strf {
  enum class lettercase { /* ... */ };
  constexpr lettercase lowercase = /* ... */;
  constexpr lettercase mixedcase = /* ... */;
  constexpr lettercase uppercase = /* ... */;
}
----

It affects numeric and boolean values:
[source,cpp]
----
auto str_uppercase = strf::to_string.with(strf::uppercase)
    ( true, ' ', *strf::hex(0xab), ' ', 1.0e+50 );

auto str_mixedcase = strf::to_string.with(strf::mixedcase)
    ( true, ' ', *strf::hex(0xab), ' ', 1.0e+50 );

assert(str_uppercase == "TRUE 0XAB 1E+50");
assert(str_mixedcase == "True 0xAB 1e+50");
----

[[constrained_facets]]
=== Constrained facets

You can constrain facets to a set of input types:
[source,cpp]
----
auto str = strf::to_string
    .with(std::constrain<std::is_floating_point>(strf::uppercase))
    ( true, ' '*strf::hex(0xab), ' ', 1.0e+50 );

assert(str == "true 0xab 1E+50");
----
, or to a set of arguments:
[source,cpp]
----
auto str = strf::to_string
    ( true, ' ', 1.0e+50, " / "
    , strf::with(strf::uppercase) (true, ' ', 1.0e+50, " / ")
    , true, ' ', 1.0e+50 );

assert(str == "true 1e+50 / TRUE 1E+50 / true 1e+50 );
----
When there are multiple facets objects of the same _category_,
the order matters. The later one wins:
[source,cpp]
----

auto fa = strf::mixedcase;
auto fb = std::constrain<std::is_floating_point>(strf::uppercase);

using namespace strf;
auto str_ab = to_string .with(fa, fb) (true, ' ', *hex(0xab), ' ', 1e+9);
auto str_ba = to_string .with(fb, fa) (true, ' ', *hex(0xab), ' ', 1e+9);

// In str_ab, fb overrides fa, but only for floating points
// In str_ba, ba overrides fb for all types, so fb has no effect.

assert(str_ab == "True 0xAB 1E+9");
assert(str_ba == "True 0xAB 1e+9");
----

[[facets_categories]]
=== Facets categories

But what does it mean for two facet objects to belong to same __facet category__?
In this library, the term _facet_ always refers to types. So the type
`strf::lettercase` is a facet, while `strf::uppercase` is a facet value.
In addition, a facet is always associated to one, and only one, facet category.
However, several facets can "belong" to the same category.

For each facet category there is class or struct
with a public static member function `get_default()` which
returns the default facet value of such facet category.
By convention, the name of such class or struct is the name of the
category, and it has the "`_c`" suffix.
For example, the category of `strf::lettercase` is `strf::lettercase_c`,
and `strf::lettercase_c::get_default()` returns  `strf::lowercase`.

Informaly ( perhaps in future it will be formal thanks to C++20 Concepts )
for each facet category there is a list of requirements a type
must satisfy to be a facet of the category. In the case of
`strf::lettercase_c`, the requirement is, well, to be the
`strf::lettercase` type, since this is only facet of this category
by design. However other categories require the facet to
contain member functions with specified signatures, effects,
preconditions, posconditions and so on.

////
If you ever need to create your own facet category ( in
case you need to a new printable type ),

One precondition for all facets, regardless of the category,
is to be move-constructible.

The design of the facets currently provided by the library
////

The design of the facets varies a lot according to their categories.
But all facets currently available in the library have something in common:
they all are small types ( in terms of `sizeof()` ) and provide a fast
copy constructor.
In addition, most of them can be instantiated as `constexpr` values.

The <<strf_hpp#facet_traits,`facet_traits`>>
struct template provides the category a given facet.

[[facets_pack]]
=== Facets packs

To avoid retyping all the facets object that you commonly use,
you can store them into a <<strf_hpp#facets_pack,`facets_pack`>>,
which you create with the <<strf_hpp#pack,`pack`>> function template:

[source,cpp,subs=normal]
----
constexpr auto my_facets = strf::pack
    ( strf::mixedcase
    , std::constrain<strf::is_bool>(strf::uppercase)
    , strf::{numpunct}<10>{3}.thousands_sep(U'.').decimal_point(U',')
    , strf::{numpunct}<16>{4}.thousands_sep(U'\'')
    , strf::<<strf_hpp#static_charset_constexpr,windows_1252>><char> );


auto str1 = strf::to_string.with(my_facets) (/{asterisk} \... {asterisk}/);
// \...
auto str2 = strf::to_string.with(my_facets) (/{asterisk} \... {asterisk}/);
// \...
----

Any value that can be passed to the `with` function, can also be passed to `pack`,
and vice-versa. This means a `facets_pack` can contain another `facets_pack`.

So the expression:
[source,cpp,subs=normal]
----
__dest-expr__.with(_f1_, _f2_, _f3_, _f4_, _f5_) (/{asterisk} args\... {asterisk}/);
----
is equivalent to
[source,cpp,subs=normal]
----
__dest-expr__.with(strf::pack(_f1_, strf::pack(_f2_, _f3_), _f4_), _f5_) (/{asterisk} args\... {asterisk}/);
----
, which is also equivalent to:
[source,cpp,subs=normal]
----
__dest-expr__.with(_f1_).with(_f2_).with(_f3_).with(_f4_).with(_f5_) (/{asterisk} args\... {asterisk}/);
----

[[locales]]
=== Locales

Strf is a locale-independent library. When you don't specify any facet
object, everything is printed as in the "C" locale.
However, the header `<strf/locale.hpp>` provides the function `locale_numpunct`
that returns a `{numpunct}<10>` object that reflects the numeric punctuation of
the current locale ( decimal point, thousands separator and digits grouping ).
`locale_numpunct()` is not thread safe. Actually using locales
in general is not thread safe. However, once you store its returned
value into a `{numpunct}<10>` object, that object is not affected anymore when
the locale changes. Also, `{numpunct}<10>` is a facet.

[source,cpp,subs=normal]
----
#include <strf/locale.hpp>
#include <strf/to_string.hpp>

void sample() {
    if (setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "de_DE")) {
        const auto punct_de = strf::locale_numpunct();
        auto str = strf::to_string.with(punct_de) (*strf::fixed(10000.5))
        assert(str == "10.000,5");

        // Changing locale does not affect punct_de
        // So using it is thread safe
        setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C");
        auto str2 = strf::to_string.with(punct_de) (*strf::fixed(20000.5));
        assert(str2 == "20.000,5");
    }
}
----

== Other destinations

Up to here, we only covered things that define the
content to be printed, not _where_ it is printed.
The <<quick_reference#,quick_reference>> provides a
<<quick_reference#destinations,list of expressions>>
that can be used instead of `to_string`, so that you can
select alternative destinations.

Now, every one of these expressions internally relies on a
concrete class that derives from the `{destination}` abstract
class template. These classes are also
<<quick_reference#destination_types, documented>>.
This means that you can write a function or code
that writes to a reference of `{destination}`, so that
it works with all kind of destinations:

[source,cpp,subs=normal]
----
void get_message(strf::destination<char>& dest)
{
    strf::to(dest) ("Hello World!");
}
----
Hence, in a sense, `strf::{destination}` is equivalent
to `std::basic_ostream` or `std::basic_streambuf`,
but with better performance, and it's easier to implement
a class that derives from `strf::{destination}`
than from `std::basic_ostream` or `std::basic_streambuf`.
